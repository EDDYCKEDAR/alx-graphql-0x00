# Rick and Morty GraphQL App

This project is a Rick and Morty application built using GraphQL, React (with Next.js), and Apollo Client to fetch and display data from the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql). The app allows users to explore characters, episodes, and more from the Rick and Morty universe!

## Features:
- View detailed information about characters by ID.
- Pagination for a list of characters.
- View episodes and their details.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI built with Tailwind CSS.

Troubleshooting
Issue: Apollo Client connection error

Solution: Double-check your query syntax and ensure the API is reachable.

Issue: Tailwind CSS not loading

Solution: Make sure you've installed Tailwind CSS and that it's properly configured in tailwind.config.js.
